Hello World!
Hello!

Imma level with you here, chief.
I started playing jazz ever since my girl left me.
Honestly, she was pretty.
Even though we're separated, I cherished every moment with her.
What?
You're wondering why I still miss her?
Honestly..... even I don't know.
ANYWAYS.
Jazz... the saxophone...
They are the most sophisticated forms of art.
Even my best friend loved Jazz.
I don't think there has ever been a moment where jazz hasn't helped me escape.
I hope you can find your own jazz in your life.

Testing this animal crossing style speech.
Is this working?
Will also demonstrate the brand new textbox system.
Heh...

ARSEN

I'm a text with a high voice!
I'm a text with a low voice...
I'm a text with a medium voice.

I have a morning ritual ` that I need to share.
I call it...
"the terminaytor".
First I pose.
Then I shriek in my infamous voice.
you know, kinda like terminaytor dude.
and I start to hum the terminator theme.
Then I slowly rise to a standing position and open my eyes.
It helps me to proceed through my day as an emotionless cyborg.
The only problem is that I get weird looks.
It ruins the fantasy.

You can faintly hear something...
It seems like she's crying.

...
Oh...
Hey...
You don't really need to worry about me.

Hey!
This place is really empty.
You should really pick up after yourself!
HA!
Sorry, I just had to...

I can't even remember the last time I ran this thing....
The fridge is filled with tons and tons of...
Bepis?
Stove is my brove.
...
(Pippi `just ``laughed).
Stove is actually my best friend.
...
(Now she's acting like she didn't hear me).

(Oh gosh, a customer came in)
Yo
...
uh...
How may I help yoooou?
Oh dear...
*Oh dear okay*
*It's fine...*
What do you want?
You want this?
Okay, it's all yours!
Erm... okay just put it back.
This one's pretty expensive.
*This kid can't be serious*
Wow.
*Where is he getting all of this money?!*
The most expensive item we have.
It's one of a kind.
In fact, I applied for this job just so I can get the money to have it.
Unless... you have enough?
WHAT
NO
I...
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
(He's pretty devastated.)
N-no it's fine.
It looked dumb and cheap anyways.
I uh... pardon me.
(He seems to be writing a note.)
(It's a formal letter to the manager asking to quit.)
Alright, I'll see ya around.
Yup, it's me again.
This time, you won't get the best of me.
I'm working full time, and I've left my wife just to save up.

This place is really something else!
It's a perfect place to visit, you know?
Peaceful, sparkly, that kind of thing. 
Er,
I guess I sound kinda cheesy, don't I?
Sorry!

Seems like you need to head for the door...
