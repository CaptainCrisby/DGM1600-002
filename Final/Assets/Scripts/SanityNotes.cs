/*      if (dialogueText.text.Contains("playerName"))
      {
        dialogueText.text.Replace("playerName", yourName);
      }

      Incredibly annoying! Been trying this code for a while on the
      "Dialogue Manager" script, but the way its programmed doesn't support variables being typed out...
      What I'm trying to do is have the script detect if the string "playerName" is in a sentence,
      followed by the script automatically replacing it with a name variable I've setup with the
      NameManager object (which will be in every scene).
      It almost works if placed toward the end of "TypeSentence", only issue is that it first types out
      'playerName' before randomly turning into your name.
      I'll look more into this tomorrow.*/
